A Netflix-inspired portfolio built with Next.js and TypeScript, focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and image optimization.

## Project Overview

This project is a portfolio website inspired by Netflix's UI/UX, built using modern web technologies. It demonstrates:

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing  
- **TypeScript** for type safety  
- **Reusable components** for scalable UI development  
- **Cloudinary** for optimized image delivery  
- **Zustand** for simple and effective state management  
- Clean and maintainable code structure  

## Features
